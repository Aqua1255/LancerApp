# Lancer-Reporting
Whenever conducting training, Soldiers are required to provide initial and closeout reports to the Brigade Operations Center for battle tracking purposes. 
Currently, this is accomplished through a variety of communication venues (email, text, phone, and in person). There is no convenient and standardized platform 
for reporting, which makes communication tedious. Why not make a battle tracking, mobile-web app the standard?

## Project Goals
+ Allow Soldiers to check in and out of training events by submitting reports virtually
+ Allow all users to view previously submitted reports for active and recently active units
+ Allow leaders to see all units actively training on a digital map 

## Key Features
+ Secure, web-based, mobile app with authentication
+ No download necessary
+ Desktop accessible
